# Personas Team 5

## Ricky

Who am I: I have programmed since I was 2 years old, and I could make this website better than you. In high school I took AP Computer Science and scored a 5. 

Main Goal: I think I want to learn how to do machine learning with data science or go into cyber security.

Main Barrier: Unsure of which classes will meet these requirements. 


## Daniel

Who am I: Came to UD as a political science major, then switched to Comp. 

Main Goal: Graduate with a Computer Science degree.

Main Barrier: Is behind on courses because of taking a semester of political science and then took classes that weren’t necessary for his concentration because of UD’s recommended CS plan, so now he’s even more behind because he didn’t take CISC181 and CISC210 at the same time and can barely get all his core classes. 



## Charles 

Who am I: Transfer with a ton of credits counting as electives

Main Goal: Graduate with a computer science degree as quickly as possible

Main Barrier: Speed is the goal, what classes fulfill more than one degree requirement? I.e. Anth229 satisfies multicultural and breadth


## Jordan

Who am I: Physics Major with a minor in math and computer science. 

Main Goal: Take fun classes in the cis department. Minimize courses taken to meet math and computer science minors. 

Main Barrier: Doesn’t know what classes are fun.


## Andrew

Who am I: Chemistry major, sophomore 

Main Goal: Get out of chemistry and get a CS degree

Main Barrier: Found out that chemistry classes are hell and did some CS classes for fun and liked those a lot better. Needs to figure out if switching out of chemistry is realistic at this point. 

## Sarah 

Who am I: a computer science newbie who has never coded before

Main goal: take my time and learn as much as I can about every computer science subject

Main Barrier: Some non computer science classes are pretty tough. I find myself spread thin on subjects that I want to learn thoroughly. I want to slow it down and graduate in 6 years
