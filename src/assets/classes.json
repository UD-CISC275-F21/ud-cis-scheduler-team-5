Everywhere they existed, from Brazil to Jamaica, from Virginia to Suriname, or from Mexico to Haiti, they proved the indomitable spirit of African people and their descendants, and the great failures of the institution of slavery. Throughout the course, we will look closely at the demographic, economic, and geographic opportunities for enslaved mobility and resistance that shaped the formation of the Atlantic world. The central focus will be an analysis of the historical impact of marronage across the Americas from 1502 to 1865.",

In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

When international law and human rights accords have become a key resource in all kinds of struggles for justice and recognition. In this course, we study the cultural dimensions of law and human rights and examine law\u2019s changing relationship to state power, the global economy, social movements, and everyday life. We approach law as a system of rules, obligations, and procedures. We also understand it as a cultural practice and moral regime. We ask: how are law, politics, and economics enmeshed and with what consequences? How does law provide tools for both social struggle and social control? How does anthropology contribute to our understanding of these issues? To answer these questions, we combine readings from classical legal anthropology with recent writings and other media produced by anthropologists, journalists, and activists working across the globe. This course is of particular interest to students concerned with law, policy, government, and related professions, as well as issues of social justice and diversity.",

The purpose of this course is to critically examine the nature and patterns of violence. A key element of the course that distinguishes it from other courses is that there is a statistical lab component that will be devoted to examining the epidemiology and etiology of violence using read data sets.  Therefore, this class is not just lecture based, but places equal emphasis on statistical techniques to answer empirical questions about violent offending and victimization.",

This class will give you the opportunity to learn about the history of American sexuality between 1600 and 2016 and gain an appreciation for its importance to our politics and culture today. We will examine a variety of topics: the history of marriage and the family, pregnancy and childbirth, contraception, abortion, sexual assault and harassment, prostitution, erotica/pornography, sexual reform and \u201csocial purity\u201d movements, sexuality and racial conflicts, trans*, same-sex desires and communities, the sexual politics of women\u2019s emancipation, and the gay rights movement. You will leave this class better informed and empowered to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing American conversation about sexuality.",

In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",
